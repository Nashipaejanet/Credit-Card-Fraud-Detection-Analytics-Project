# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Analytics-Project
## Project Description
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify suspicious transactions accurately while minimizing false positives, which is critical in financial systems.

The project follows a complete data analytics workflow, including data exploration, cleaning, feature transformation, model development, evaluation, and business-focused visualization. A Power BI dashboard is included to present fraud trends, transaction patterns, and key performance metrics in an intuitive and decision-friendly format.

By combining predictive modeling with interactive dashboards, this project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support fraud prevention, risk management, and operational decision-making in the financial sector.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Power BI  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  

## Project Workflow / Features
1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning** – Understanding the dataset, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.  
3. **Model Development & Evaluation** – Training classification models to detect fraud and evaluating them using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
4. **Visualization** – Power BI dashboard to visualize fraud trends, transaction patterns, and key performance metrics.  
5. **Predictive Modeling** – Identifying high-risk transactions in real time.
