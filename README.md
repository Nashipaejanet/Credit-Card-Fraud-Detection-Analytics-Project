# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Analytics-Project
## Project Description
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify suspicious transactions accurately while minimizing false positives, which is critical in financial systems.

The project follows a complete data analytics workflow, including data exploration, cleaning, feature transformation, model development, evaluation, and business-focused visualization. A Power BI dashboard is included to present fraud trends, transaction patterns, and key performance metrics in an intuitive and decision-friendly format.

By combining predictive modeling with interactive dashboards, this project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support fraud prevention, risk management, and operational decision-making in the financial sector.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Power BI  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  

## Project Workflow / Features
1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning** – Understanding the dataset, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.  
3. **Model Development & Evaluation** – Training classification models to detect fraud and evaluating them using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
4. **Visualization** – Power BI dashboard to visualize fraud trends, transaction patterns, and key performance metrics.  
5. **Predictive Modeling** – Identifying high-risk transactions in real time.

## Getting Started
To run this project locally:  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
git clone https://github.com/Nashipaejanet/credit-card-fraud-detection.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection

3. Install required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for analysis:
jupyter notebook

5. Open the Power BI dashboard file (.pbix) to explore visualizations and key metrics.

6. **Usage**
- Run the notebooks to explore data, train models, and evaluate results.
- Open the Power BI dashboard (`Credit_Card_Fraud_Dashboard.pbix`) to interact with visualizations and key performance metrics.
- Use the trained model scripts to predict high-risk transactions on new datasets.

7. **Results / Dashboard Preview**
- Detects suspicious transactions with high accuracy, minimizing false positives.
- Visualizes fraud trends, peak transaction times, and high-risk cardholders.
- Supports decision-making in fraud prevention, risk management, and operational planning.
- Example dashboard screenshots can be added here or in a `/screenshots` folder.

8. **Contributing**
- Contributions are welcome. You can submit pull requests for bug fixes, new features, or improvements.
